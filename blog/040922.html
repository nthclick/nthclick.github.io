	<h1>i HATE css</h1>
    <p>alright ill say it, i fucking hate css. its annoying and boring to make and im not gonna be impressed by your average looking website
    which you slaved away on for hours to get it to work. even still it makes things incompatible. even simple pictures will render old browsers not able to render
    the pages, which is why this blog will be fully compatible with ancient browsers
